          <p class="lead">
            Our products are top of the line and have many features. Our cameras
            use
            <strong class="text-danger">face recognition</strong>, which can
            recognise when anything resembling a face is shown to the camera. We
            also have a built-in
            <strong class="text-danger">face identification</strong> system
            which allows users to add a database of images of people they know,
            so that the camera will identify them. Through our website,
            customers can, using their unique account, view data the camera
            stores. For example, if your friend John was at the door at 12 o
            clock today, that would be stored in the website, or if an unknown
            person passed the camera at a different time, that would also be
            stored.

    <h4 class="lead">
      We believe in today's world, it is important to have access to a home
      security feed <strong class="text-danger">wherever</strong> you are.
      Whether you are at work or somewhere else. Many companies provide
      doorbells that do just this, however we decided to go a different route.
      One issue we saw was that none of these devices provide access to any
      data, or let you view your data through any web browser, rather than an
      app.
