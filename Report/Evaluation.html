            <p class="lead my-4">
              Overall I believe I managed to reach the Design requirements I had
              set beforehand, not to the highest degree but certainly to a
              certain degree due to bad time management. My design ambitions
              were far from achieved unfortunately as my frontend did not look
              as nice as I was hoping and a lot of the code was not straightened
              out fully to my desire.

            <h2>In relation to the brief</h2>
            <p class="lead my-4">
              I believe I met the brief requirements to a reasonable degree, in
              the context of the advanced requirements I had a login, a sign up
              and a newsletter data capture form which satisfied the "1 or more
              data capture" requirements. I had validation checks throughout all
              3 data capture forms, requiring a valid email in all of them and a
              valid length for a password etc. <br>
                For the basic requirements I had
              more than 4 pages, used paragraphs, lists (home page) images etc. and a crisp
              consistent visual design using bootstrap. The website was also
              accessible as it was responsive to different screen sizes.
              <br />
              My artefact was standalone and could be monitored via the website
              which meets the advanced and basic artefact requirement.

            <h2>The needs of the envisaged end user</h2>
            <p class="lead my-4">
              I was able to satisfy the needs of the envisaged end user to a
              basic standard in my opinion, however I believe if YouTube had
              different embed policies and allowed me to stream my camera live
              onto the website I would have met the user needs to a much higher
              level.

              <h3>Some Improvements I could make:</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Have the data from firebase extracted in a more aesthetic way, and display in a way that is much easier to read.</li>
                  <li>Have a live feed on the control panel that allows the user to see their camera</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Alternative use:</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>After further development my system could be used to lock/unlock a door if a recognised face is shown</li>
                  <li>My system could include a security alarm for unkown face detection</li>
              </ul>
