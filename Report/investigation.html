                    User can view whenever motion is detected near their camera (access via login)

                  <li>
                    Rejected as I felt motion was not the most useful thing to
                    be aware of as it could be triggered by many things
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Originally rejected for seeming too simple however I was quite lucky to reject it as Youtube's streaming
                    and embedding rules would have kept me from displaying my live feed on the site.

                    A front porch camera which can detect and identify faces it sees, and forward that data to a website. (access via login)

                    Could meet the requirements via a login system (data
                    capture) to access a control panel (to monitor embedded
                    system). This would be done using flask.

                    <li>
                      One social implication could be that the camera would record people without consent.
                      A stakeholder would be parents wanting to monitor their home/children when not at home.

            <h2>Research (Ring)</h2>
            <p class="lead my-4">
              One of the main existing solutions I conducted research on was
              <a
                href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-does-ring-doorbell-work?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=The%20Ring%20doorbell%20works%20by,make%20your%20home%20more%20secure."
                >Ring doorbells</a
              >. Ring doorbells allow a user to see their live video feed wherever they are. This means it is
              a standalone device and it can operate as part of a single system.
              The Ring doorbell feed can be accessed via an app when a user logs
              in. Through this research I decided I wanted to design a front
              porch security camera.

              Another existing solution I did research on was the

                >Google Nest</a
              >
              and its many variations. Upon further research into the Google
              Nest I found that it had a built in face recognition function, but
              not a face identification function. This inspired me to include face identification.

            <h2>Flask</h2>
            <p class="lead my-4">
              Like Ring, I needed to have a login system to access the
              feed, so I looked into various methods to do so. The most suitable
              method I found was using Flask, a micro-web framework written in
              python. I learnt a lot about flask through
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&t=3286s"
                >this</a
              >
              Youtube tutorial by Tech with Tim. Through Flask I could create a
              database of Users to login and I could also retrieve data entered
              in forms within the website, which would then meet the
              requirements for the website. While conducting more research into
              flask, I found I could use flask to include python functions
              within a HTML file. I could also
              place if statements within my HTML file, so that certain pages
              will not show up unless a user is logged in.

            <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
            <p class="lead my-4">
              In the brief one of the requirements for the website is a clean,
              crisp and consistent visual style. Using the CSS
              framework Bootstrap would have be perfect. I watched
              several
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqOEoUR5RHg"
                >tutorials</a
              >
              about bootstrap and learned that keeping a consistent design using
              bootstrap was very easy. To meet another requirement, I needed the
              website to be responsive so that it would be easily accessible to
              people no matter what device/browser they are using.(inclusive to all users) To my
              delight, this was even easier to do using Bootstrap. Bootstrap has
              built in functionality for making certain features responsive.
              Including sm before a certain style in the class tag will cause
              that style to only happen on small screens. For example if I
              wanted to center certain text but only on small screens, I could
              use sm-text-center.

            <h2>OpenCV</h2>
            <p class="lead my-4">
              OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning
              software library. OpenCV has thousands of algorithms used for
              machine learning to detect and recognise faces, or identify
              objects, or even classify human actions. I chose to use OpenCV to
              create my face recognition and identification program as it had
              useful built-in functions to help me and I could easily train my
              algorithm using my own data.
